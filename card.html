                    A panda baby is born pink, blind and without any teeth. After a few weeks, the skin will turn gray, and by the time a month passes, the cubs are covered in the well known (and extremely fluffy) black and white fur. A panda cub will weigh about 100 pounds (45 kilos) by the time it is one year old.

                Giant pandas have a distinctive black and white coat, with black fur around their eyes and on their ears, muzzle, legs and shoulders. Their thick, wooly coat helps to keep them warm in their cool mountain homes.
